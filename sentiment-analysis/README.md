# Sentiment Analysis Projects

This folder contains experiments and projects related to sentiment classification tasks.

The goal is to compare different text representations and machine learning models, with a focus on:

- Bag of Words
- TF–IDF
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes
- Tokenization strategies
- Model evaluation and error analysis

Each notebook includes methodological explanations, performance comparison, and discussion of results.

Additional sentiment analysis experiments will be added over time.
